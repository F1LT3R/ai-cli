In the context of monospace terminals, "WC" stands for "Width Character." It refers to the width of a character when displayed in a monospace (fixed-width) font, where each character occupies the same amount of horizontal space. 

This concept is important in text formatting and layout, especially in programming and terminal applications, where precise alignment of text is required. The width character measurement helps developers understand how much space a particular character will occupy on the screen, allowing for better formatting and alignment of text in terminal-based interfaces. 

Note that "WC" can also refer to "Word Count" in some contexts, particularly when discussing text processing or file analysis, but in the context of display width in terminals, it specifically relates to the width of characters.
