I would like you to add some syntax highlighting for the save dialog. So I would like yellow for the save file question request but keep the URL for the file in normal text color. So I want the brackets in square brackets highlighted too. 

And then I want to do the same thing for the successful save but make that green. 

And do the same thing for the successful context update and do that in cyan.
