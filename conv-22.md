In Markdown tables, if you do not specify any alignment details, the content is left-aligned by default. Here's a clarification of how to set up alignment:

- **Left Alignment**: Use `:---` for the header separator.
- **Center Alignment**: Use `:---:` for the header separator.
- **Right Alignment**: Use `---:` for the header separator.

Here's a corrected version of the table with a mix of left, center, and right alignment:
